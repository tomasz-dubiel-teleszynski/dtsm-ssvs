%
% This function adjusts diagonal K1Q_X to give a non-diagonal but more
% computationally tractable K1Q_X.
%
%
% K1Q_X can fall into a few cases:
%   0. diagonal
%   1. not diagonal
%   2. zero eigenvalue
%   3. near repeated roots
% In cases 1-3, the diagonal closed form solver doesn't work, so compute differently.
% In case 1-2, we will use the recursive solver, though there are more efficient methods.
% In case 3, we will add a positive number above the diagonal.  this gives a different member of the set of observationally equivalent models.
%   So for example:
%      [lambda1, 0; 0, lambda2] is replaced by [lambda1, f(lambda2-lambda1); 0, lambda2] when abs(lambda1 - lambda2)<eps0
%   By making f not just 0/1, it will help by making the likelihood
%   continuous if we parameterize by kinf. (not an issue in some cases.)
%
% We also order the diagonal of diagonal K1Q.
